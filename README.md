KCSE 2025 National Schools Performance Dashboard
Project Overview

This project presents a comparative analysis of KCSE 2025 examination performance across five national secondary schools in Kenya. Using simulated examination data structured to reflect official KCSE reporting formats, the dashboard delivers insights into overall school performance, grade distribution, subject-level outcomes, and executive decision metrics.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow, from data preparation in SQL to interactive reporting in Power BI.

Objectives
Compare overall academic performance across selected national schools
Analyze grade distribution patterns and performance polarization
Evaluate subject-level strengths, weaknesses, and variability
Provide actionable insights to education boards, school leadership, and parents

Data Source
Simulated KCSE 2025 examination results modeled on official examination structures
Data prepared, cleaned, and validated using MySQL
Final datasets imported into Power BI Desktop for analysis and visualization

Tools and Technologies
MySQL – data modeling, validation, and preparation
Power BI Desktop – data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization
DAX – advanced measures, KPIs, and analytical logic
GitHub – version control and portfolio hosting

Dashboard Pages and Key Insights
